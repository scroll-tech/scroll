## Dependencies


### Foundry

First run the command below to get foundryup, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

If you do not want to use the redirect, feel free to manually download the foundryup installation script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/foundry/master/foundryup/foundryup).

Then, run `foundryup` in a new terminal session or after reloading your `PATH`.

Other ways to install Foundry can be found [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).


### Hardhat

```
yarn install
```


## Build

+ Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialise git submodules.
+ Run `yarn prettier:solidity` to run linting in fix mode, will auto-format all solidity codes.
+ Run `yarn prettier` to run linting in fix mode, will auto-format all typescript codes.
+ Run `forge build` to compile contracts with foundry.
+ Run `npx hardhat compile` to compile with hardhat.
+ Run `forge test -vvv` to run foundry units tests. It will compile all contracts before running the unit tests.
+ Run `npx hardhat test` to run integration tests. It may not compile all contracts before running, it's better to run `npx hardhat compile` first.
