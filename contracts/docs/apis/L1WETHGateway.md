# L1WETHGateway



> L1WETHGateway

The `L1WETHGateway` contract is used to deposit `WETH` token on layer 1 and finalize withdraw `WETH` from layer 2.

*The deposited WETH tokens are not held in the gateway. It will first be unwrapped as Ether and then the Ether will be sent to the `L1ScrollMessenger` contract. On finalizing withdraw, the Ether will be transfered from `L1ScrollMessenger`, then wrapped as WETH and finally transfer to recipient.*
