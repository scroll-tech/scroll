# L2StandardERC20Gateway



> L2StandardERC20Gateway

The `L2StandardERC20Gateway` is used to withdraw standard ERC20 tokens in layer 2 and finalize deposit the tokens from layer 1.

*The withdrawn ERC20 tokens will be burned directly. On finalizing deposit, the corresponding token will be minted and transfered to the recipient. Any ERC20 that requires non-standard functionality should use a separate gateway.*
