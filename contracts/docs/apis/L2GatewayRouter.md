# L2GatewayRouter



> L2GatewayRouter

The `L2GatewayRouter` is the main entry for withdrawing Ether and ERC20 tokens. All deposited tokens are routed to corresponding gateways.

*One can also use this contract to query L1/L2 token address mapping. In the future, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens will be added to the router too.*
